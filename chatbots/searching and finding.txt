# import L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
oz_text = open("the_wizard_of_oz_text.txt",encoding='utf-8').read().lower()

# search oz_text for an occurrence of 'wizard' here

found_wizard = re.search("wizard", oz_text)

###
Unlike match, search checks the entire string. Like match, it will return one matching part of the string (as a match object). .findall() will return *all non-overlapping sequences* that match the given arg.
