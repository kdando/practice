####
Function tokenises a text, then for each token it checks if that token is present in the box_dictionary object. if it is, the VALUE is iterated by 1. If not, this is the first appearance, so the VALUE of that token in the dictionary is set to 1. Basically, this function counts the appearances of a token.
