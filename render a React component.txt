import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}

// component goes here:
<MyComponentClass />

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponentClass />, document.getElementById("app"))

//////////
Put the component as the 1st argument in ReactDOM.render -
this will call the render method of the instanced component -
which it inherits from the component class that is its blueprint (i.e. to display "Hello world" in <h1> size)
