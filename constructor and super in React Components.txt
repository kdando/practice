class App extends React.Component {
	// constructor method begins here:
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { title: "Best App" }
}
	
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>
        Wow this entire app is just an h1.
      </h1>
    );
  }
}

////////
State is not passed from outside and should be set in the constructor class.
State should be an object.
State is a property and is declared inside a constructor function, inside the constructor class. It is a separate function alongside the render function.
Super is being called as part of this constructor function. It is done to inherit the props from the parent class (here, that's the React.Component).
React Components ALWAYS must call super in their constructor functions.
