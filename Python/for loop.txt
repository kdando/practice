board_games = ["Settlers of Catan", "Carcassone", "Power Grid", "Agricola", "Scrabble"]

for game in board_games:
  print(game)

for x in sport_games:
  print(x)

"game" or "x" here is a temporary variable - it doesnt need to be defined beforehand.
indentation matters in Python: everything at the same indentation as "print" here is considered one block of code. so the loop would run it all
