# the second function here works by creating a list of numbers to be looped through - we are looping through the username string /indirectly/..."letter" is a temp variable that starts at 0 by default. and since it is in a for loop that loops through a range from 0 to the length of username, it counts up to the right point. we add the shifted characters by using the temp variable as index position for chars in username. then finally we plus 1 to the temp variable. #
