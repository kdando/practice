current_budget = 3500.75

def print_remaining_budget(budget):
  print("Your remaining budget is: $" + str(budget))

print_remaining_budget(current_budget)

# Write your code below: 

shirt_expense = 9

def deduct_expense(budget, expense):
  return budget - expense

new_budget_after_shirt = deduct_expense(current_budget, shirt_expense)

print_remaining_budget(new_budget_after_shirt)

### new_budget... variable gets its value by calling the deduct_expense function with 2 other variables given as arguments. This function returns a value, which is then assigned to new_budget... if the function just printed the result of its calculation, for example, then the new_budget wouldn't be assigned anything because no data is being returned ###

### RETURN MULTIPLE VALUES:

def top_tourist_locations_italy():
  first = "Rome"
  second = "Venice"
  third = "Florence"
  return first, second, third

most_popular1, most_popular2, most_popular3 = top_tourist_locations_italy()

print(most_popular1)
print(most_popular2)
print(most_popular3)

### Here the function returns 3 values (the value of the 3 variables). By calling the function as part of an assignment, the 3 values returned are assigned to 3 new variables stated. They are assigned in order so first becomes most_popular1 etc. ###
