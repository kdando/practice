with open("welcome.txt") as text_file:
  text_data = text_file.read()
  print(text_data)

# Use "with open("something.blah") as somethingelse" to open a file called something.blah and tie its contents to a variable called somethingelse. Use the .read() method to copy its contents, here to another variable which is then printed. #

### read() copies the entire contents of a file. But we can also iterate over each line in turn with .readlines(), e.g.:

with open("how_many_lines.txt") as lines_doc:
  for line in lines_doc.readlines():
    print(line)

### or we can read individual lines, .readline() goes through the file 1 by 1. If it reaches the end subsequent calls will return an empty string.

with open("just_the_first.txt") as first_line_doc:
  first_line = first_line_doc.readline()
  print(first_line)

### add "w" as a second argument to open a file in write-mode (default is "r", read-only). Use the write method to overwrite it completely. ###

with open("bad_bands.txt", "w") as bad_bands_doc:
  bad_bands_doc.write("The Shit Band")

### open with "a" for append mode - so anything you write will be an addition rather than an overwrite:

with open("cool_dogs.txt", "a") as cool_dogs_file:
  cool_dogs_file.write("Air Buddy")
