import json

with open("message.json") as message_json:
  message = json.load(message_json)
  print(message["text"])

### The json module has a simple method .load() to parse json files into python dictionaries. ###

data_payload = [
  {'interesting message': 'What is JSON? A web application\'s little pile of secrets.',
   'follow up': 'But enough talk!'}
]

import json

with open("data.json", "w") as data_json:
  json.dump(data_payload, data_json)

### To export as json data we use .dump() method. The first argument is object you want to export, the second is where or what you export it as. so here we are taking the payload object - a list containing a dictionary - and overwriting the "data.json" file entirely with it (because we opened in "w" mode rather than "a"). ###
