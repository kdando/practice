function convertHTML(str) {

//assign var newStr as the result of:
//a) finding any of the characters (first arg in .replace)
//b) replacing them with the result of:
//c) the return value from the function.
//the anonymous function sends back the data with return. no need to try and do a replace or splice or anything complicated within that function.
//.replace(a, b) means find a and replace it with b. if b is a function whatever is found (a) will be replaced by the result of the function (b). so just send data back to it and you have your correct answer.
