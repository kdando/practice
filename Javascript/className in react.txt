import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Write code here:
const myDiv = (<div className="big">
I AM A BIG DIV
</div>)

ReactDOM.render(myDiv, document.getElementById("app"));

//////
Can't use "class" as attribute in JSX, has to be className.
If JSX is multi-line, has to be bracketted ().
ReactDOM.render() appends the 1st arg to whatever element is given as 2nd arg.
